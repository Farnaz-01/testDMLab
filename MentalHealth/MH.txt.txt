Kindness (ihsān and raḥmah) is the fragrance of a purified heart. To be gentle with others is to reflect the Divine Attribute of Ar-Raḥmān. Often, those who are kind heal not only others but also their own wounded hearts, because compassion is an act of remembrance — a reminder that every soul before you is a sign of Allah.
