Tests — whether of the body, mind, or soul — are not punishments, but invitations. Allah does not test to break you; He tests to purify you, to remove the veils between you and Him.
Every hardship is a form of Divine conversation — Allah is speaking to your heart without words. If you respond with ṣabr (patience) and ridhā (contentment), the pain transforms into light.

You were not created to collapse under the weight of life — you were created to rise through it. Every difficulty that bends you is secretly teaching you how to bow only to Allah. 🌙

When the world turns its back, it is Allah turning you back to Him. When your plans fall apart, it is because His plan is unfolding — one you cannot yet see, but one that will make sense when your heart is purified enough to understand it.
