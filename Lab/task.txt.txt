Tests — whether of the body, mind, or soul — are not punishments, but invitations. Allah does not test to break you; He tests to purify you, to remove the veils between you and Him.
Every hardship is a form of Divine conversation — Allah is speaking to your heart without words. If you respond with ṣabr (patience) and ridhā (contentment), the pain transforms into light.
